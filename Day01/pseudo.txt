Part 1:

Load File

For each line in the file: 
  Create a 2 digit number based off the the first numerical digit and the last numerical digit. 
    If the line only has 1 digit, use it twice.
  Add each lines result to the total

Print out the total.

Part 2:

Load File. Each line in the file contains a combination of letters and numbers.

For each line in the file:
  Replace the following strings with the associated number in this order.
     oneight, 18
     threeight, 38
     fiveight, 58
     nineight, 98
     sevenine, 79
     one, 1 
     two, 2 
     three, 3
     four, 4
     five, 5
     six, 6
     seven, 7
     eight, 8
     nine, 9

  Create a two digit number based off the the first numerical digit and the last numerical digit found in the string of numbers and letters. 
    If the line only has one digit, use it twice.
    For example:
       If the input is 1abc2 then the first digit would be 1 and the last digit would be 2 so the result would be 12.
       If the input is pqr3stu8vwx the first digit would be 3 and the last digit would be 8 so the result would be 38.
       If the input is a1b2c3d4e5f the first digit would be 1 and, even though 2, 3, and 4 are present, the last digit is 5 so the result would be 15.
       If the input is treb7uchet the first digit would be 1, but since it's the only digit, it would also be the last digit so the result would be 77.
