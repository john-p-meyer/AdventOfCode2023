Prompt (P): Can you write a code in Python that follows the logic on the following pseudo code.
            Feel free to make any improvements to the flow such as combining steps to make it 
            flow better.

            Load File

            For each line in the file: 
               Create a 2 digit number based off the the first numerical digit and the last numerical digit. 
               If the line only has 1 digit, use it twice.
               Add each lines result to the total

            Print out the total.

Answer (A): Sure, here’s a Python code that follows the logic you provided:

            The create_2_digit_number function takes a string num and returns a 2 digit number based off the the first numerical digit and the last numerical digit. If the line only has 1 digit, it uses it twice.

            The sum_of_2_digit_numbers function takes a file path file_path and returns the sum of 2 digit numbers created from each line in the file. It uses the create_2_digit_number function to create 2 digit numbers from each line.

P: For the function "reate_2_digit_number(num: str)" num can be a combination letters an numbers. So for example, if the 
   input is 1abc2 then the first digit would be 1 and the last digit would be 2 so the result would be 12.
   If the input is pqr3stu8vwx the first digit would be 3 and the last digit would be 8 so the result would be 38.
   If the input is a1b2c3d4e5f the first digit would be 1 and, even though 2, 3, and 4 are present, the last digit is 5 so the result would be 15.
   If the input is treb7uchet the first digit would be 1, but since it's the only digit, it would also be the last digit so the result would be 77.

   Can you rewrite the function to do this instead?

   The create_2_digit_number function takes a string num and returns a 2 digit number based off the the first numerical digit 
   and the last numerical digit. If the line only has 1 digit, it uses it twice.

   The function first finds the first and last numerical digits in the string. If there is only one numerical digit, it uses 
   it twice. It then concatenates the first and last numerical digits to create a 2 digit number.

   The sum_of_2_digit_numbers function takes a file path file_path and returns the sum of 2 digit numbers created from each 
   line in the file. It uses the create_2_digit_number function to create 2 digit numbers from each line.

P: We now need to modify the function create_2_digit_number so that, if the numbers 1 through 9 are spelled out, they are
   treated as a digit. The following are examples with results:

   If the input is two1nine, the two is treated as 2 and the nine is treated as 9 so the first digit is 2, the last digit is 9, so the result is 29.
   If the input is eightwothree, the eight is treated as 8, the two is treated as two, and the three is treated as 3 so the first digit is 8 and the last digit is 3, so the result is 83.
   If the input is abcone2threexyz, the one is treated as 1, the three is treated as 3, the first digit is 1 and the last digit is 3, so the result is 13.
   If the input is xtwone3four, the two is treated as 2, the one is treated as 1, the four is treated as 4, the first digit is 2 and the last digit is 4, so the result is 24.
   If the input is 4nineeightseven2, the nine is 9, the eight is 8, and seven is 7, the first digit is 4 and the last digit is 2 so the result is 42.
   If the input is zoneight234, the one is 1, the eight is 8, the first digit is 1 and the last digit is 4, so the result is 14.
   If the input is 7pqrstsixteen, the six is 6, the first digit is 7 and the last digit is 6, so the result is 76.

P: In create_2_digit_number, I think your need to convert all the spelled out numbers to digits first before figuiring out 
   the 2 digit number.

   Can you write a code in Python that follows the logic on the following pseudo code.
   Feel free to make any improvements to the flow such as combining steps to make it 
   flow better.

   Load File. Each line in the file contains a combination of letters and numbers.

   For each line in the file:
     Replace the following strings with the associated number in this order.
        oneight, 18
        threeight, 38
        fiveight, 58
        nineight, 98

        five, 5
        six, 6
        seven, 7
        eight, 8
        nine, 9

     Create a two digit number based off the the first numerical digit and the last numerical digit found in the string of numbers and letters. 
       If the line only has one digit, use it twice.
       For example:
          If the input is 1abc2 then the first digit would be 1 and the last digit would be 2 so the result would be 12.
          If the input is pqr3stu8vwx the first digit would be 3 and the last digit would be 8 so the result would be 38.

     Add each lines result to the total.

   The replace_strings_with_numbers function replaces the strings in the order specified in the pseudocode with their 
   associated numbers. The create_two_digit_number function creates a two digit number based on the first and last 
   numerical digits found in the string of numbers and letters. The process_file function reads each line in the file, 
   applies the two functions to each line, and adds the result to the total.

   You can use this code by calling the process_file function and passing the file path as an argument. For example, if 
   your file is named data.txt and is located in the same directory as the Python script, you can call the function like 
   this:

   Python
   AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

   total = process_file("data.txt")
   print(total)
   
   This will print the total of all the lines in the file after processing them according to the given pseudocode.
